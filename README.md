# CS-210
I have two projects from CS-210 in this repository, one for Airgead Banking and the other for Corner Grocer. Airgead Banking wanted a investment calculator for a user to follow prompts such as initial investment amount, interest, amount of years,
and have the program calculate totals based on the user's input. Corner Grocer wanted a program to read an input file, assign items into a map for their frequency, then write a file with the item name followed by the frequency it showed up
in the input file.
I believe I followed industry standard coding practices, as in the code is in a clear layout that is easy to read and look for errors, the code would be easy to maintain or modify, and almost every line has a comment detailing what the code is
supposed to do. However, there are many ways I could enhance my code. An example of an enhancement would be having print functions displaying in better format that is easy for a user to read and understand. Another enhancement I could make is using
pointers in my code with bigger projects I am working on, but I still need practice as I'm not particularly comfortable with them yet.
The most challenging code I wrote was in the Corner Grocer where I used a map to take in information and store it in an item and a frequency. I don't even honestly know how I fixed it, for the longest time that program would not print a frequency list
or histogram though I didn't understand what was wrong. To overcome this, I watched informational videos on c++ about maps and how to interact with them through functions.
All the skills I learned through these two projects will greatly aid me in my future school career and eventually in my work. C++ is a great coding language and I would like to understand it more. I started with Python, and this made me believe that
coding was going to be a breeze. After getting through the tough parts of C++ and learning how OOP is preferable, what I have learned here has even helped me with my work in JAVA and Python.
I made these programs maintainable, readable, and adaptable by formatting them in object orientated programing and with frequenct in line comments to describe my code, therefore it is easy to search for what needs to be maintained or changed in the 
future.
